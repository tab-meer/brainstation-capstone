## MoodSync - A Mood-Based Spotify Song Recommendation System

### Project Overview  
#### Problem Area
How can we use machine learning to improve music recommendation for users to quickly create personalized playlists based on their mood? While services like Spotify allow manual playlist creation, there is a lack of intelligent automated features. Spotify has experimented with an AI feature called 'DJ', which learns usersâ€™ music preferences and when activated, plays a curated lineup of songs in real-time, mimicking a live DJ experience. There is an opportunity to enhance music recommendation by integrating this feature into playlist creation, refining 'DJ' to generate playlists based on user inputs such as mood, offering a more innovative and personalized music experience.

This project addresses issues faced by Spotify users, specifically those seeking more efficient and personalized playlist creation. Potential beneficiaries encompass music enthusiasts, tech-savvy users, and busy casual listeners seeking variety in their day-to-day.

#### Proposed Solution
Envision a system that categorizes songs by moods using audio features, building on Spotify's DJ feature to refine user preferences through mood classification. Users would input a mood, and the feature would instantly create a unique curated playlist. This ensures diverse music experiences even for the same mood, with the option to save playlists for later.

#### The Impact
Enhancing user experiences on platforms like Spotify meets the widespread demand for efficient and personalized playlist creation, impacting millions of users. This time-saving feature appeals to users seeking instant and tailored music recommendations, boosting user retention and loyalty. It encourages diverse music exploration and positions Spotify as a technological innovator through AI and machine learning, strengthening investor relations. The data-driven insights from user preferences would help inform strategic decisions in content acquisition, marketing, and feature development.
